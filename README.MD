# Overview

I have made my own version of the game 2048. In the game there is a 4 x 4 grid of tiles that either are empty or have a number divisable by two. You can combine tiles by moving all tiles on the board in one direction. If two tiles with the same number collide, they combine in to one tile with double the value. The goal of the game is to get a tile to reach 2048, but if you fill the board and can no longer combine tiles you lose. I used an object oriented method of programing in this project by making each tile in the grid a Tile object.

I chose to make a simple game in c++ in order to tune my skills in it as it had been a while since I had used the language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used VS Code as my IDE with the extensions C/C++, C/C++ Extension Pack, and Code Runner. As well as g++ for the complier.

As mentioned I made this project using C++. I also used the following libraries: iostream, string and sstream for displaying in the terminal and stdlib.h
